Designed by Abhishek Nandekar. The shape represents an iteration of the __Koch Island__, which
is a fractal (when iterated to eternity). Each side of the Island is the Koch Curve which has a fractal
dimension (box-counting dimension) of 1.28. The interior contains **binary digits** (“bits”) and the title
of the course is in vintage computer font types (a tribute to the yesteryears of computing). **H(X) bits**
is the representation of Claude Shannon’s most famous Entropy term for random variable X. The
fundamental unit of information is ‘bit’ or ‘shannon’.
